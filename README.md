# FAQ CHATBOT ðŸ¤–
## Introduction
Getting answer automatically is magic!! Its real AI . This project is a simple Question & Answer based chatbot framework. Uses similarity based on different vectorizers, to find the matching question then responds with its corresponding answer.

# Core Features of the Bot

### Regional language

It is a multi-lingual bot. This bot supports selective regional languages , such that the user can interact with this chatbot in their own language. The bot answers the query in the respective language it has been asked. 

### Whatsapp Integration

The chatbot can be integrated with whatsapp which simplifies the user experience. It is not necessary for the user to get into the website to interact with this bot, the interaction with this bot can be done through the whatsapp as well.

### Speech Recognition

This bot is a speech recognition bot in which user can interact using their voice. Visually Impaired people can also access the required  information through voice recognition.With the help of speech recognition we analyze the input and process it to get the desired output.


# How it works?
This bot uses AI Technology to generate answers automatically based on the question asked. It is an AI based Chatbot which is built on flask.
 The chatbot uses , highly pre-trained dataset using scikit-learn and tensor flow which increases the overall accuracy of the bot. The bot 
works on the category classification method in which the query dataset is categorized . when a question is asked the bot trains itself to
  fetch data from that particular category which results in quick response. 
## Algorithms used
**Bert generator** <br>

  BERT or Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers is a transformer-based machine learning technique for NLP. It is a pre-trained deep bidirectional representation from the unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context. It is a transformer language model with a variable number of encoder layers and self-attention heads.<br>

The Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) is a platform used for building Python programs that work with human language data for applying in statistical natural language processing (NLP). It contains text processing libraries for tokenization, parsing, classification, stemming, tagging and semantic reasoning.It is a field that focuses on making natural human language usable by computer programs.<br>

**Speech Recognition**<br>

Speech recognition training allows AI models to understand unique inputs present in the recorded audio data. Machine learning has still a long way to achieve perfection in many cases.The software is programmed in such a way that it entirely covers up all nuances present in human speech like speech length, voice pattern, tone frequency, etc.

 **DeepL Translator**<br>

 . DeepL Translator draws from Linguee's massive corpus of manually translated sentences, idioms, and text snippets. It translates texts using artificial neural networks which are highly trained<br>


## TECH STACK
**Core Programming language - python** <br>

 This bot is fully developed in python language with the help of  python modules, algorithms and frameworks.  Python is a fast, versatile way to store and retrieve data by way of a name or even a more complex object type, rather than just an index number.<br>

**Core framework - Flask**<br>


 It is a python framework which is used for developing this web application . It has a built-in debugger that provides virtual debugging.<br>

**Frontend  - HTML5, CSS3 & JS **<br>

GUI of this bot is built in basic HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript languages, which provides an user friendly UI. <br> 

**Database - CSV** <br>
 
This bot does not uses any seperate data base for storing the query data set instead its put into a CSV file.
